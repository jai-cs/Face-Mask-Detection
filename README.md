# Face-Mask-Detection
<p>In this project, we are developing a website for Face Mask Detection. Here the users can view statistics for the Covid-19 pandemic. One can also see whether or not the mask has been properly worn by a person or not. We also have an admin panel where the admin can insert pictures and details for statistics. This system makes it very convenient to check whether a person has worn a face mask or not without human contact, ensuring social distancing.</p>

<p>The project can be implemented locally by cloning the repository and running the manage.py file using Django. You will need to install Python and Djnago to run the website and a Database Manager to view images.</p>
